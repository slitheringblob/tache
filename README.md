# Tache

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Note: Dont worry when you go to `localhost:4000` and it shows an error. Just append any one of the endpoint URLs from below and it should work.
## Endpoints:

| Endpoint | HTTP Method | Usage |
| :---         |     :---:      |  :---: |
| /counter   | GET | Takes you to the DumbCounter Page  |
| /todo   | GET | Takes you to the task-list page  |
